#01_refactor_hw

# So what I did for the homwork is spaced out a lot of things took some stuff out, made 4 different style.css for the amount of styles on one page.

# Ok so first what I did was for the refactor part which I linked 4 different style sheets and changed the website to Horiseon SEO instead of just website.

# The second thing I did was changed the div class header to nav class header and added in my navigation tabs.

# I changed the div class content to nav class content.

# I changed the div's in the class content to "sections" I then changed the paragraphs to articles.

# Then I changed the div's in the class benefits to "asides" and changed the paragraphs to articles.

# For the style sheets I made 4 different stylesheets split them up on the MAIN one and commented them out and Then I linked them to the Indexhw.html
